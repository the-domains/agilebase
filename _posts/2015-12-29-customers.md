**Jardox**

> Jardox has been using Chilli since 2009  and the implementation of this easy to use, intelligent system has made everyone's life easier. Importantly for Jardox, which operates in the ever-changing food sector, Chilli's systems are extremely flexible, allowing for necessary updates to accommodate our every need. The system has saved us time and money and we really value Mark's great experience and brilliant can-do attitude. We consider Chilli to be an extension of the Jardox team.

Alex Gardener, Managing Director

**Markus**

We took a leap of faith to become the first commercial customer for Chilli Software in 2008\. We've never regretted taking that decision and can only see further ways that we can obtain business benefits from continued development of Chilli.

Our business was at a point where we needed to consolidate from several independent systems in different parts of the business to a centralised information source. With our business being bespoke manufacture, and lead times getting shorter all the time, we needed an integrated system to give as close to real time data as possible, shared across departments.

> What is now the Chilli software had the added benefit of evolving with need, so changes in business demand could be adapted for. This is a facet that we have made and continue to make much use of. As the demands of our customers and business change, we are modifying Chilli to work for us, rather than having to adapt ourselves around a less flexible system.

> Chilli has helped pieminister to cope with it's complex, unique requirements and rapid growth. Chilli's approach was to gain a true understanding of the way we work and to make the software work for us, unlike previous software which we were having to try adapt to.  The other great thing about working with Chilli is their in depth understanding of the workings and complexities of the food industry, which meant that we actually improved many of our internal processes whilst implementing the software. Simply put, this software has improved our business and saved us a fortune.

> We needed software that we could change quickly, that was agile and that could fit the way that we worked. I saw agileBase and knew that it would be an easy system to roll out. We involved the staff in the process, building the processes around their roles and got the software up and running within two weeks.
