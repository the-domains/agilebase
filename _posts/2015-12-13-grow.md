# Additional Capacity

agileBase is all about flexibility. If your use doesn't fit into one of the standard packages, we can customise it.

Each of the four areas (users, records, tables, or data storage), can be expanded individually to the limit of the next package, for a fixed price of £100/month.

Our pricing structure shows the 'core' platform charge, along with per-user (depending on type of user) and subsidary charges based on usage. Please contact our sales team for some examples and details of how you can cost-effectively build your applications and data on the agileBase platform.
