# Features / Benefits

agile:NPDtech is built for speed, innovation and for control.

The NPD team can innovate, rapidly creating new products and variants to find new customers and better serve existing ones.
The Technical team can ensure compliance; controlling allergens, species, countries of origin and the like and producing detailed specifications, keeping pace with the ever-stricter technical requirements of the food industry.
Both NPD and Technical requirements are catered for and seamlessly integrated:

_**innovation with compliance**_.

agile:NPDtech is a no compromise solution that takes our expertise from the past ten years of food manufacturing into an exciting new world where product development doesn't have to mean bureaucracy and new recipe ideas can flourish.

The software takes care of tracking and recording all information along the development lifecycle, from idea (whether internal or customer-led) through to briefs and samples then finished products. Automated notifications mean the right decision makers are kept in the loop at all times but no one's bombarded with unnecessary alerts and emails.

We follow an agile methodology that gets the best out of your NPD staff, giving full reign to their creative spirits, while giving your Technical staff the control that they - and your customers - need.
