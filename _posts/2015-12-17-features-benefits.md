# Features / Benefits

agile:Food is built for speed, and also built for control.

The goal of any New Product Development (NPD) department in a food manufacturing organisation is to innovate, rapidly creating new products and variants to find new customers and better serve existing ones.

Coupled with this is the need for compliance. In today's world, every aspect of traceability and recipe information must be covered and the requirements are only getting stricter.

agile:Food's NPDtech product is a no compromise solution that takes our expertise from the past ten years of food manufacturing into an exciting new world where product development doesn't have to mean bureaucracy and new recipe ideas can flourish.

The software takes care of tracking and recording all information along the development lifecycle, from idea (whether internal or customer-led) through to briefs and samples then finished products. Automated notifications mean the right decision makers are kept in the loop at all times but no one's bombarded with unnecessary alerts and emails.

We follow an agile methodology that gets the best out of your NPD staff, giving full reign to their creative spirits.
